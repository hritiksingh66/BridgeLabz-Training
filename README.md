## 🧠 Why This Repository Exists

This is **not** a showcase repo.  
This is a **learning repository** meant to prove:

- Consistent Java practice
- Clear understanding of fundamentals
- Logical problem-solving ability
- Structured learning (not random copy-paste code)

If someone can’t see the value here, they don’t understand how developers actually grow.
